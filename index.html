What type of system are you using?? = 
   wrong     = hp / dell / lenovo  
   correct   = windows / mac / linux / 
  Laptop ----> server 

Example of Operating system = OS  
   Linux OS 
   Windows OS  ---
   Solaris    
   Mac OS 
   IOS -   
   Android -  
   Chrome os =

Tesla employs you as their DevOps Manager  = $280,000/yr USD:
===========================================================
Ticket001: Please brief us on the factors to be considered when choosing 
           the best Operating system to use for projects.

What determines the choice of either Linux or windows OS:
1. Security - Linux is more secured 
    Linux systems are not vulnerable to virus attack  
    Windows systems are vulnerable to virus attack 

2. cost - Linux
    Linux is a free and an Open source OS == $0.00
    Windows is a licenced/PAID OS         == $500

2B. Open source - Linux  
    Linux is an Open source OS  
    Windows is not an Open source OS   
      -- Cocacola         = $2 [ no recipe available  ] 
      -- fuleri           = $0 [ no recipe available  ]   
      -- soft             = $0 [ recipe available for free ]
      -- landmarksoft     = $0 [ no recipe available  ] 

  If the recipe(source code) is available, then the software is an open source software   

3. usage : [Linux]
    85% of servers are Linux based
    Linux OS is mostly utilised for Enterprise tasks
    Windows is utilised as Workstations

    Dress A  =  9/10  
    Dress B  =  1/10 

    Toyota  =  4m / CRM 
    Ford    =  2m 

4. support  [ Linux ]:
    Linux has a very large, effective and free community support[2b]
    Windows support is available Only from Microsoft[10M] & paid for.  
    
5. performance 

6. Reviews 

7. speed 

8. scalability and elasticity
    Linux OS  = SMA = 10m users / 25m / 200m / 100m  

============================================

Linux OS and Linux Commands
============================ 
Linux is an Open Source Operating System
Linux started around 1991 by Linus Torlvads
Linus was using a Solaris system for his project.
  -- Encounter problems running his project  
  -- He contacted the vendor but the response was delayed 
Unlike IBM AIX, Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Windows OS  
Linus created the Linux OS from the Solaris kernel/OS []:
Linux is case sensitive = 'ls' is driffent from 'LS' or 'Ls' or 'lS'  

How are softwares made available by vendors?                    :
  1. open source: [Free including The source code]  
     open source softwares has more community support

  2. Free: [free but without the source code(recipe)] 

  3. Licenced: [paid for, Windows OS, Office365] 

Linux is an open source OS with multiple destributions/versions.
1)  Redhat
2)  CentOS
3)  Ubuntu.
5)  Fedora
6)  Gentoo
7)  Mandriva.
8)  Debian.
9)  Slackware
10) Amazon Linux 2 AMI
11) LandmarkLinux 

You work for LandmarkFinTech applications as DevOps Engineer:
Servers are needed to build and deploy the LandmarkFinTech application  
Explain how we can obtain these servers and get our applications  
online within the shortest possibility. 

Approaches:
1. Buy a Linux server from the market 
   Configure the server  = COST = 35,000USD 
   time 30-90days = 100x x=500min    

2. Use a hypervisor to create a Linux Virtual machine on an existing system
   4TB GB SSD / 512GB memory = 3,000USD  = 10x, 50min
   hypervisor = hyperV, VirtualBox, vmWare   
   UP TO 40hrs  to install and deploy applications    

3. Use a cloud computing provider [aws, azure, GCP, etc.]
       500 - 1,000 USD  TIME= X, x=2 - 10 mins  
       8GB and 256/500G SSD

Ticket002: Create a free account in AWS Cloud:
       website: aws.amazon.com
       Root user email address: class38@mylandmarktech.com    
       tel no: +14372152483  
       credit card: 45784125489764
       password: Licom2045@
Ticket003: Launch a Redhat9 Linux DBserver in AWS:
    1. login into your aws account 
        email : class38@mylandmarktech.com 
                simon@dominionsystems.net  
        password: 000147ggfds 


  Launch instance
  To get started, launch an Amazon EC2 instance, 
  which is a virtual server in the cloud.
1. You need an aws account 
   Login into your aws account  
       Root email address:  abc@gmail.com   
       password: Admin@123 

2. Search aws ec2 service console  
   Launch your Linux ec2-instance/VM/server 
   We need the server to run tasks for clients [tesla/boa/dod]   

Ticket004: connect to the Redhat9 demoServer using mobaXterm SSH-CLIENT: 
3. Connect to the server and run tasks 
   - You need a computer, e.g windows system/computer 
   - SSH (secure shell) protocol is required  
   - we need an ssh-client software e.g mobaXterm     
   - We need the server's details:
        public-ip-address:   3.145.46.69
        userName: ec2-user   
        password:   
        ssh-private-Key:  key39.pem 
     ssh -i key39.pem ec2-user@3.145.46.69 = when using sshkey    
     ssh ec2-user@3.145.46.69  = when using password  

4. Open ssh-port=22 on the server firewall / security Group 
Start running tasks and workloads on the Redhat9 Enterprise Linux system :
(demoServer) 

Open an SSH client software = terminal / 
Open an SSH client software = gitbash
Open an SSH client software = mobaXterm  

ssh -i "key39.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-145-46-69.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
ssh -i "key39.pem" ec2-user@3.145.46.69

Linux File Structure:
=====================
Linux File Structure starts with the root directory(/)
All others directories are sub-folders/directories from the /.

 Windows file Structure start from drive 'c' [C:\]

ls dirName  = List the content of the dir
ls   = List the content of the pwd
ls / = List the content of the root directory (/) 

$ ls /
afs  boot  efi  home  lib64  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
bin  dev   etc  lib   media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr

bin:contains binary files(commands) 
=== 
  ls / pwd / whoami / hostname   

Laptop[mobaXterm]----connect---->server   

sbin: contains system binary files(commands) 
================== 
  sudo / adduser / useradd / usermod / groupadd 
  Only users with elevated/admin/root priviledges can   
  run commands found in the sbin directory
  All users can run commands found in the bin directory  


Open an SSH client.
Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is key39.pem
Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
chmod 400 "key39.pem"
Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
ec2-3-145-46-69.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
Example:
ssh -i "key39.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-145-46-69.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com


what is the difference b/w bin and sbin?
  Both are directories containing binary files[commands] 
  files in the bin directory can be run by any user   
  files in the sbin directory can ONLY be run by users with  
  admin/root priviledges.

sudo -u root adduser simon
sudo = is the command that allow a user to run commands as another user    
   ls = list the content of a directory as the current user   
   sudo ls -u simon = list the content of a directory as simon's user

/home: contains normal user's home dir details  
===============================
  sudo adduser userName    
  sudo adduser sama


etc: contains Configuration files    
===================================
  /etc/passwd   
  /etc/shadow   
  /etc/ssh/sshd_config  

opt: Where packages are downloaded into the server.
=== 

lib: 

var: contains variable files    
==========================
 /var/logs/messages  

/tmp : TEMPORAL FILES ARE FOUND  
=====   
/home /etc  /sbin  /tmp  /opt  /lib /var 

File and directory management Commands:  
Navigation and Directory Control Commands:
======================================
  mkdir dirName = this command create a directory   
  mkdir class
  ls dirName  = List the content of the dir
  ls  = List the content of the pwd
  ls class  = List the content of 'class' directory
  ls /home  = List the content of '/home' directory

  rmdir  dirName = delete empty directories     
  rm -rf dirName = delete any directory     
  pwd  = present working directory  
  cd dirname = change directory

  touch fileName1 fileName2 ... fileName100  = create empty files 
  touch file1 file2 file3 file4 
  touch file1
  touch file2 
  touch file3

solution:
 1. touch list.txt hello.py greet.sh app.java monitor.sh deploy.sh  
 2. multiple commands
     touch list.txt 
     touch hello.py
     touch greet.sh 
     touch app.java 
     touch monitor.sh 
     touch deploy.sh 

Create a file [list.txt] and add content??    
========================================= 
solution:
 echo "I Love Landmak Technology"
 echo "I Love Landmak Technology" > love.txt   

cat fileName = display/read the content of a FILE    
 cat love.txt   

  append/add [>>] add content in a file
  redirect/replaces [>] content in a file   

Text editors: vi/vim/nano  
========================  
We shall use the vi command:
  vi list.txt 
vi has 'insert' mode and 'command' mode:

1. You start accessing the file in command mode 
   In command mode we can't modify file's content
     press the 'i' key to enter "insert" mode :
        In insert mode we can add content to files or  
        modify the file  

     after modifying the file press "esc key" to enter command mode :
2. In order to Save and Quit: 
    1. press "esc key" to enter command mode 
    2. type ':wq' or ':wq!' and press the enter-key to save and quit

 short-cut -- Save and Quit: 
    press "esc key" to enter command mode
    do a quick double press on the shift+z key  
    to save and quit = press+hold '

3.  Quit without saving:  
     press "esc key" to enter command mode          
     type ':q!' and press the enter key to quit without saving

What is the difference b/w hard line and soft link?
1. Hard link to a file is a copy of that file   
   software is a short-cut to that file 
2. Hard link has the same size as the the original file  
   software link file size is significantly smaller to the file size. 
3. If the original file is deleted we can't access the file using the
   soft link which is the reverse with the hard link  
4. soft link optimising resource utilisation better that hard link
    file=200mb hardlink=200m softlink=2mb

What is the default umask value of a normal user?  0022     
Set a custom umask value to ensure that:
  All file created should inherit 0444 Permissions  
  All file created should inherit 0600 Permissions


what is umask value?? umask is use to determine/set the Permissions that 
files and directories will inherit at creation. Good for file security. 
umask value set the Default files permissions for users.
what is the Default file permissions for root and normal users?:
    0644 and 0664 respectively.
what is the umask value for root and normal users?:  0022

chmod and chown:
  changing the file's permissions and/or ownership  

   umask    
   chmod   
   chown  
   chgrp  

How can access be granted to a file/directory?
1. By changing the file's permissions [ chmod umask ]   
2. By changing the file's ownership   [chown, chgrp]  

ticket005c: Grant write access to simon in the list.py file owned by ec2-user.

 2. add write permission to the group =
    chmod g+w  list.py 
    chmod 0664 list.py
    chmod 0660 list.py
 3. add write access to the owner =
    chmod u+w  list.py 
    chmod 0600 list.py
    chmod 0644 list.py

 2. change ownership to simon   
    sudo chown simon list.py  
    sudo chown simon:simon list.py  

 2. change the group ownership to simon

User Mgt:
=======
User/group Management:
=====================
1. root user :
   The root user is the administrator or admin user, superuser  
   that can run all commands and tasks unrestricted 
   He has unrestricted access into files, directories, etc. 
   In Linux the root user is called = root

2. system users: 
   are created by the system during installation/setup and when  
   settings softwares/applications are installed 

3. normal users:
   Are created by the administrator [root user]  

Important userMGT files :      
  /etc/passwd  = contains users account details  
  /etc/shadow  = contains users password details  

  su = switch user    
  su - ec2-user = this will switch to the ec2-user account with password request
  sudo su - ec2-user = this will switch to the ec2-user account without password request


Normal Users: Are created by the administrator [root user]    
  adduser = will create a user in a linux server   
  useradd = will create a user in a linux server

IQ: John is unable to connect to the DB Linux server. 
    Please explain what could be the problem.
answer:
1. Check if John is running the ssh commands correctly
    ssh userName@ipaddress 
    ssh -i key.pem userName@ipaddress  or   
    ssh ipaddress@userName
    ssh -i key.pem ipaddress@userName

2. Check if the ssh-Port22 is open on the server firewall/SG
   inbound Rule: open port 22 for John to have access   

3. Check if the server is up and running 
     ping ipaddress/hostname/dns  

4. check if the ssh service(sshd) is running and react accordingly
